            <p>Our Greek salad isn't steeped in ancient myths, but it carries the warmth of family gatherings and shared laughter. And now you can cook this delicasy.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients We Love</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sun-Ripened Tomatoes: These tomatoes, kissed by the sun, offer a burst of sweetness. Their vibrant red hue beckons you to take a bite.</li>
                <li>Crunchy Cucumbers: English cucumbers bring a cool crunch. They're like whispers of summer in every forkful.</li>
                <li>Red Onion Balance: Thinly sliced red onion adds a gentle kick. It's the perfect balance in our Greek Salad.</li>
                <li>Feta, Our Culinary Anchor: Feta crumbled and creamy, is the heartbeat of our salad. It's not just cheese; it's a burst of flavor.</li>   
            </ul>
            <h3>The Lemon and Red Wine Vinegar Tango</h3>
                <p>
                    Our dressing is a twirl of lemon and a dip of red wine vinegar.<br>
                   The lemon brings zest, while the vinegar adds depth. Together they add the flavor to the salad.

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Freshness Matters: Begin with the freshest ingredients. Ripe tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, and vibrant bell peppers are key. Seek out authentic Greek feta.</li>
                <li>Tomato Technique: Use Roma tomatoes or vine-ripe tomatoes. They stay somewhat firm when ripe, which pairs well with the crunchy bell pepper and onion.</li>
                <li>Cucumber Sweetness: Opt for English cucumbers—they tend to be sweeter. If using standard slicing cucumbers, fully peel their bitter waxy skin.</li>
                <li>Onion Soak: Red onion adds mild sweetness. To further soften its edge, soak it in ice water and a dash of vinegar.</li>
                <li>Red Bell Pepper: Choose a firm and smooth green bell pepper. It's the only bell pepper used in an authentic Greek salad.</li>
                <li>Feta Wisdom: Greek feta is the key for a good salad. Look for whole blocks packed in brine—it not only tastes better but allows you to serve large, crumbled chunks.</li>
                <li>Amazing Olive Oil: Look for pure extra virgin olive oil. It tastes better and can really change the taste.</li>
                <li>Realemon lemon: Pure Lemon Juice is the best. Realemon is what I prefer.</li>
                <li>Top It Off: Use fresh oregano and dill for a perfect taste.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Prepare veggies and mix in a bowl. Then add oregano, dill, salt, and groung pepper. Add olive oil, lemon juice, and red wine vinegar. If you want a more sour and tangy approach, add more lemon juice and a little more red wine vinegar.

            <h2>Serving Suggestions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Grilled Fish, Chicken, or Lean Red Meat: A flaky fillet of grilled halibut, juicy chicken breast, or a sirloin steak is a perfect pair. Their simplicity is great with the tangy freshness of Greek salad.</li>
                <li>Mediterranean Dishes: Set your Greek salad alongside classics like hummus, baba ghanoush, or crispy falafel. The shared origins create a harmonious meal.</li>
                <li>Kebabs and Kabobs: Whether it's beef souvlaki kebabs or veggie skewers, the smoky char complements the salad's vibrant ingredients.</li>
                <li>Roasted Chickpeas: Swap falafels for roasted chickpeas. They add crunch and protein. Flavor them with lemon and oregano or get creative with chili and lime.</li>
                <li>Harissa Chicken: If you haven't tried harissa, now's the time! Its sweet, smoky heat pairs wonderfully with Greek salad. Serve it with a yogurt sauce for balance.</li>
                <li>Greek Lamb Chops: Create restaurant-quality lamb chops at home. A simple lemon and oregano marinade, followed by a quick sear, is all you need.</li>
